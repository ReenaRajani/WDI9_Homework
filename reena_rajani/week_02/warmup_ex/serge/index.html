<!--
Serge answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

What do you need to do?

Make an HTML file with an input field and a button
Write the javascript file that adds an event handler to the button and retrieves the details from the input field
Figure out the appropriate response (from the above conditions)

If you are flying through it, go and make something cool with the styling
