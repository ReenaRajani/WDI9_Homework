/*
For example, given the collection of numbers:
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
And the operation:
- square a number
Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:
- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
## Restrictions
 
Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
 
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.
 
By the way, make this the most horrible looking site in the World
Animations etc.
